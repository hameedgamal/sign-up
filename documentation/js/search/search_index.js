mocking data in integration test https://fakerjsdocs.netlify.app/\n\nFolder structure\n\nRoot: e2e; Where integration test is manage\n\nLocators: Map for elements with [data-locator] attribute, that attribute is used to locate elements for test\nPageObject: Breaking page into objects to make it easier for accessing in spec while writing test cases\nData: Map for static data, like error message, so the spec file will be clean and more focus on test flow, also easier to manage changes in static data.\nSpecs: spec file to test the integrated components in Sign Up single page app\n\n\nRoot: src/app; source code for the app\n\nApp root component: main component for the app\nApp module: main module for the app\nComponents:\nAll child components that are used in main component app\nAll components are dumb except the SignUpFormComponent , that one is a smart component where the logic for calling the API is managed and all child components are render with needed inputs\n\n\nServices:\nUserService where the API call for demoAPI is managed\n\n\nShared:\nValidation: reactive form validation along with validation messages\nModels: types & interfaces\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture & approach\n\nFull adoption of Angular framework, for example using Reactive forms.\nSmart & dumb components:\nWhere the business log is manage in smart components and dumb component are only for presentational layer, dumb components are NotificationComponent, FieldValidationMessageComponent and smart component is SignUpFormComponent\nSignUpFormComponent includes a presentational layer but since the application is not complex I decided to make the smart component but that can be improved\n\n\nUsing a light weigh CSS Framework \"Bulma\"\nSave time to focus on application logic\nZero CSS/styles\nresponsiveness and more...\n\n\nUnit testing: basic unit test and not covering all units\nE2E/Integration test, provided coverage for two scenarios\nFill all required info and submit, verify that success notification is shown\nSkip one required filed and verify that validation error is shown for each field with the correct message\nNote: test is not stable because of missing password pattern for fackerJs password mock method\n\n\n\nResources\n\nValid password pattern: https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php\nValid email pattern: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601647/html5-email-input-pattern-attribute\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
